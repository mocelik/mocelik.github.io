### Embedded Systems

I am Muhammed, the author of this website, which I hope to use to document the information that I’ve found useful over my career. Initially, I stored useful resources as bookmarks in my browser; over time, my workplaces began disallowing the use of browser profiles, and so I wasn’t able to transfer my bookmarks from one place to the next. I thought of making this website to store those bookmarks for me. Eventually, I realized I’d like to share some of what I know, so I started writing. I found that writing was good for me, so I am now trying to write more often.

Academically, I have a bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. Professionally, I have been working in embedded software systems since 2019. There are parts of software where I am strongly opinionated; other parts where I don’t care at all. I have been told that I’m able to respectfully challenge differing opinions; I believe this is the way to go.
